🚘 AI-Powered Vehicle Inspection: Automated Damage Detection and Assessment
This repository showcases AutoInspect, an AI-driven system for automated vehicle damage detection and severity assessment. The project is a result of research and development work conducted as part of my contribution to VehicleCare.

📖 Abstract
Traditional vehicle inspection methods can be time-consuming, inconsistent, and susceptible to human error. AutoInspect leverages Computer Vision and Deep Learning to perform accurate, real-time assessments of vehicle damage using both images and video input, aiming to bring speed, standardization, and trust to the vehicle servicing and insurance process.
